# P2PFileSharing
P2P file sharing system - Fall 21 Computer Networks- Project group 12

Peer to Peer file sharing project using BIT-Torrent protocols. The project members are:
  Ashwin Gopinath
  Kunal Dudhe
  Shreeya Deshpande
  
Procedure to run:
Place all the files on the CSE server within a same folder and then compile using the command - javac *.java
After that you can run the StartRemotePeers file which starts all peers and runs the whole program - java StartRemotePeers
To terminate the program after communication: pkill -u <username>

Note: In the video link attached, only the termination part is missing. But at the end you can observe that the communication stops once all the peers have the source file.
